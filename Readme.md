# Anti-Theft System
This repository contains code and documentation for an Anti-Theft System using the ESP32 CAM module, interfaced with a passive infrared sensor. The system detects motion, captures an image, and sends it to the owner's Telegram bot. For proof of operation, see page 9 of the project report. This project was completed as part of the ECE384 Open Lab Project.
